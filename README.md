Just walked out of Henry Danger: The Movie and whew, y'all. I mean, who even came up with this? Did they wake up one morning and say, You know what the world needs? More Henry Danger! Seriously, my brain is still trying to compute what just happened on that big screen. Halfway through, I was trading glances with the lady next to me—she looked like she'd rather be folding laundry, to be honest. But then there was this kid a few rows down just loving every second of it, popcorn flying everywhere like confetti. Bless him.

First things first, the plot. It jumped around more than my cat on catnip. One minute it’s all serious superhero business, the next second it’s jokes only a 12-year-old would get. Do kids even care about plot? Or is it just the explosions and flashy suits? I mean, jokes on me, right? The sarcasm’s dripping but... isn't that the point? To distract us from our adulty worries even if it means stepping into this chaotic Disney-channel-on-caffeine universe?

> Oh, and let's talk about the villain for a hot second. Sketchy with a capital S. Like, where do they find these guys? Does he go grocery shopping with the cape on? Imagine running into him at the store, trying to pick between organic and non-organic carrots like he's deciding on his next evil plan. Must-talk-stupidly-slick and have exaggerated expressions - check! Who needs realism when you have a script, right?

Random flying jet skis! Why? Because they can! I mean, honestly, if they could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   into our brains, they would and it would still be nonsensical. And then, bam! Dance-off! It’s a   for everyone and no one at the same time. Funny how that sounds like my feelings about laundry—sometimes you hate it, sometimes... you just hate it less?  

function saveTheDay(hero, sidekick) {
   // a magical solution that requires no logic
}

By the end, I'm sure I was a little more invested than I'd care to admit. There’s something bizarrely charming about Henry and his goofy sidekick antics. Like a hyperactive cousin you have to look after, they’re annoying but you miss them when they’re gone. But let’s be real, you're not gonna find me standing in the rain asking Why, oh why, can’t I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again right now? Maybe in another universe, who knows? Alright, time to dive into a bowl of cereal and pretend I'm a responsible adult again.
